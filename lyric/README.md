# Lyric

Lisp-dialect focused on providing uniform code and data interface for
[vrs](https://github.com/leoshimo/vrs/).

## Goals

- Simple
- Dynamic scripting environment
- Embedding within Rust programs
- Ease of native bindings
- Serializable data structures and code

## REPL

There is a binary target that exposes a simple REPL:

```sh
# in vrs root folder
$ cargo run --bin lyric
```
