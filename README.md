## What is this?

[vrs](https://github.com/leoshimo/vrs) is a WIP personal software runtime,
inspired by Emacs, Erlang, Unix, Plan 9, and Hypermedia systems.

Its key principles are simplicity and joy.

## Status

vrs is in early design stage. The runtime primitives are under rapid iteration
and experimentation!

Focus on key areas, such as security and performance, are deferred for now.

## Structure

- `libvrs`: The `vrs` library crate shared by runtime and client implementations
- `vrsd`: A runtime implementation as a system daemon
- `vrsctl`: A thin CLI client over `libvrs`
- `lyric`: Embedded Lisp Dialect and Virtual Machine
