## Structure

- `core`: The `vrs` library crate shared by runtime and core
- `runtime`: The runtime implementation for `vrsd` daemon
- `vrsctl`: A CLI shell for interacting with runtime

## What is this?

This is a WIP personal software runtime so I can write software the way I want to.

My inspirations are:

- Emacs
- Unix
- Plan 9
- Hypermedia systems
- Erlang

and the goal is to bundle my favorite parts from each of those systems into one software runtime.

### Thoughts / Quotes that map project in latent space

> The experience of `emacs` everywhere

> If `xdg-open`, `systemd`, and `dbus` raised a child in an alternative universe where Lisp replaced XML as dominant configuration language

> The thing about ideas, is that ideas start out small... tiny and weak and fragile... Ideas need an environment where creator can nurture them.. feed them and shape their growth
