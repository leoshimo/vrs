## What is this?

[vrs](https://github.com/leoshimo/vrs) is a WIP personal software runtime,
inspired by Emacs, Erlang, Unix, Plan 9, and Hypermedia systems.

It hopes to combine powerful ideas from those systems into one cohesive project,
so I can build rich personal software ecosystems and superplatforms at the speed
of thought.

Its key principles are: 

- simplicity
- progress
- joy

## Status

vrs is a sandbox project, focused on play and experimentation in a pure-fun,
pure-utility environment. While I live-on vrs everyday, the platform is very
volatile in both concepts and implementation. Be warned!

## Structure

- `libvrs`: The `vrs` library crate shared by runtime and client implementations
- `vrsd`: A runtime implementation as a system daemon
- `lyric`: Embedded Lisp Dialect and Virtual Machine
- `vrsctl`: A thin CLI client over `libvrs`
- `vrsjmp`: A GUI launch bar client
