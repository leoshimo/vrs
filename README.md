# vrs - vrs runtime system

ðŸš§ Under Heavy Construction

## What is this?

VRS Runtime System is a WIP personal software runtime, inspired by Emacs,
Erlang, Unix, Plan 9, and Hypermedia systems.

The goal is to bundle my favorite ideas from each of those systems into one
software runtime to make building software joyful (for me).

## Status

VRS is currently in **design phase**. The runtime primitives are under rapid
iteration and experimentation.

Focus on key areas, such as security and performance, are deferred for the time being.

## Structure

- `libvrs`: The `vrs` library crate shared by runtime and clients
- `vrsd`: A daemon runtime implementation
- `vrsctl`: A CLI client for interacting with runtime
- `lemma`: Embedded Lisp dialect and environment

## Logging

Set `RUST_LOG` to configure logging level. Default is `info`

```sh
# logging level to debug
$ RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin vrsd
```
