## What is this?

This is a WIP personal software runtime so I can write software the way I want to.

My inspirations are:

- Emacs
- Unix
- Plan 9
- Hypermedia systems
- Erlang

and the goal is to bundle my favorite parts from each of those systems into one software runtime.

### Thoughts / Quotes that map project in latent space

> The experience of `emacs` everywhere

> If `xdg-open`, `systemd`, and `dbus` raised a child in an alternative universe where Lisp replaced XML as dominant configuration language
